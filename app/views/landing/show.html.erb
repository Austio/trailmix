  <h1>Welcome to Trailmix.</h1>
  <p class="lead">Private journaling about your life.</p>
<% end %>

<p>Hey there,</p>

<p>Want to know the <strong>hardest part about keeping a journal?</strong>
Actually keeping one.</p>

<p>Like most habits, it's easy for the first few days, but soon a lack of
motivation or simple forgetfulness sets in.</p>

<p>That's why we built Trailmix.</p>

<p><strong>Every day, Trailmix sends you an email asking how your day
  went.</strong> All you do is hit reply and start typing. When you're done,
hit send, and your entry will be saved instantly.</p>

<p>With every reminder email, <strong>we'll include one of your previous
  entries chosen at random</strong>. You might get one from yesterday, last
week, or last year.</p>

<p>This makes opening our emails fun! It's delightful to be reminded of your
former thoughts and feelings. Even yesterday's entry can surprise you.</p>

<p>This enjoyable feeling will encourage you to write more, so that
future-you can enjoy reading today's entry.</p>

<p><strong>Before you know it, you're a daily journaler.</strong></p>

<p>Once you've built this habit, you get a tremendous payoff: the ability to
look back over your life experiences. You'll notice patterns like "I always
seem stressed on Wednesdays!" Or "Wow, I was so worried about that
talk with my boss, but it turned out completely fine."</p>

<p>Insights like these can have a <strong>profound effect on your happiness and
  behavior.</strong> We know, because we've experienced it ourselves.</p>

<p>If you'd like to experience this too, you can sign up below.</p>

<p>Trailmix costs $8.99/month, but it's free for 15 days. You can cancel at any
time, before or after you're charged.</p>

<p>We charge for Trailmix because it costs money to run servers and fix bugs,
but we're not in this to get rich. We're in it because <strong>we believe daily
journalers are happier people and we want you to become one.</p></strong>
